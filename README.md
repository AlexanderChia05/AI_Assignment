Console-based / Split algorithms

- Problem   : Maze
- Algorithm : Uninformed / Informed / Local 
- Language  : Python
--------------------------
- **Each Grp** is required to choose one Search Problem.
- **Each Grp Member** is required to **ONE** search algorithm to solve the problem.

**Chosen Algorithm should based on these 4 criteria:**
  - Completeness
  - Cost-optimality
  - Time complexity
  - Space conplexity

**Generate 10 different sets of test data for the selected problem.**
  - Each set should consist of a START and a GOAL state
  - Both state can be determined by the group or randomly generated
  - GOAL states can be same or different place but START state must be different
